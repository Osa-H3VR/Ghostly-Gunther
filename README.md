# Ghostly-Gunther

```
You are the only man I can trust for this job
Get in and get out
Should be a breeze for someonelike you
```

## Description:
The main goal here is to create a character that REALLY punishes you for any mistake you take. The goals are:
 - Make you rethink every decision
 - Make flashbangs the main tool for breach-style gameplay
 - Force player to first clear the area and only then shoot the nodes
 - Every noise needs to be a decision
 - Only low calliber weapons available, making you rethink how to dispatch enemies
 
##### NOTE: Sosigs have slightly different AI now, some old trick may not work anymore.

## Progression changes:
- Enemies are easily blinded by flashbangs
- Supply and hold sosigs have much faster reaction time, they're expecting you
- Patrols have slower reaction time, and drop useful stuff
- Much better hearing range, but lower vision range
- Slower movement speed and higher hpfor the sosigs
- No hp weenies and only single hp crates in supplies
- Only low cal weapons, attack its weak point for massive damage
